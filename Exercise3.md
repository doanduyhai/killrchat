Exercise 3
==========

 First checkout the branch **exercise_3_specs** with Git: `git checkout exercise_3_specs`

 In this exercise, we are going to manage participants joining and leaving chat rooms
and also the deletion of the chat room by the creator in a manner that is concurrency-proof

 To complete the exercise, open the **`ChatRoomService`** and implement the remaining methods to make the tests greens.
Follow the instructions and read the documentation link ( **if necessary, don't spend too much time on it** )


Solution
========

 The solution is given in the branch **exercise_3_solution**.

 Do not forget to save your work (if you want to keep track
 of your solution) in a branch and then check out with Git: `git checkout exercise_3_solution`
