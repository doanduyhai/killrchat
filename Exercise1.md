Exercise 1
==========

 First checkout the branch **exercise_1_specs** with Git: `git checkout exercise_1_specs`

 In this exercise, we are going to define an **`UserEntity`** and implement the **`UserService`** to make all tests
 in **`UserServiceTests`** class pass.

1. open the **`UserEntity`** and follow the instructions. You must add appropriate annotations on this entity
2. open the **`UserService`** and implement all the methods to make the tests greens. Follow the instructions and
read the documentation link if necessary (it should be straightforward)

Solution
========

 The solution is given in the branch **exercise_1_solution**.

 Do not forget to save your work (if you want to keep track
 of your solution) in a branch and then check out with Git: `git checkout exercise_1_solution`
